Sangu
=====
Sangu is a simple app for tracking checklists.

Usage
=====
Basically, it's all a javascript one page.

There's an intention to build a server component for it, but right now the server just serves up static pages.

Install/Setup
=============
Make the resource/public files available on a web server, and bring in the dependent css/js libraries. (TODO: Add a script here.)

If you have a jvm with lein installed, you can run

    sh scripts/start-web.sh
